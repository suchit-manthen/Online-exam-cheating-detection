# AI-Based Online Exam Proctoring System

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered online examination platform designed to detect and prevent cheating in real time.  
It uses webcam-based monitoring, behavioral analysis, and face authentication to ensure fair and secure online assessments without the need for human invigilators.

The system automatically detects suspicious activities, issues warnings, and terminates the exam when predefined thresholds are exceeded. An admin dashboard is provided for full auditability of exam attempts.

## Cheating Detection Logic

### Event Weights (Example)
| Event Type            | Weight |
|----------------------|--------|
| NO_FACE              | 3      |
| MULTIPLE_FACES       | 5      |
| LOOKING_LEFT/RIGHT   | 2      |
| PHONE_DETECTED       | 5      |
| COPY_PASTE           | 4      |
| TAB_SWITCH           | 3      |
| FACE_MISMATCH        | 5      |

### Thresholds
- **0–4** → No warning  
- **5–7** → Warning  
- **8–11** → Warning (Yellow)  
- **12–14** → Final Warning  
- **≥15** → Exam Terminated  

### Final Attempt Status
- **COMPLETED** → Submitted normally, score below threshold
- **FLAGGED** → Exam abandoned without submission
- **TERMINATED** → Cheating score exceeded threshold or identity mismatch

## Face Authentication Flow

1. Student logs in
2. Face verification page opens
3. Webcam captures face and stores reference embedding
4. Exam starts only after successful face registration
5. During the exam:
   - Each frame is compared with the stored embedding
   - Consecutive face mismatches trigger warnings
   - Repeated mismatch leads to exam termination

## Current Project Status

### Completed
- Full exam lifecycle (login → verification → exam → submit/terminate)
- Webcam integration
- Face direction detection
- Phone detection
- Copy–paste and tab-switch monitoring
- Admin dashboard with detailed logs
- Face authentication and continuous identity verification
- Backend modularization and error handling

### Optional Enhancements
- Audio-based cheating detection
- Coding questions with secure editor
- Face embedding encryption
- Browser/device fingerprinting
- Charts and analytics in admin dashboard
- CSV/PDF export of exam reports
